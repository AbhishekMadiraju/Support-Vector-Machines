Used scikit-learn to calculate accuracy of SVM over various datasets

Wrote a python program using scikit-learn to calaculate accuracy of SVM on various datasets using linear and radial kernel.
I have included the datasets used along with the source code. To run the program, you need to provide the dataset you want to use as the function parameter.

Due to hardware constraints, execution speed can be expected to decrease for few datasets.

Apart from this, I have also included a file SVM_Final.pdf which contains calaculated accuracies across various datasets and a Powerpoint Presentation related to SVM given by me.
